            Who will prove to be the strongest in the course of this? The most
            moderate; those who do not require any extreme articles of faith;
            those who do not concede but love a fair amount of accidents and
            nonsense; those who can think of a man with a considerable reduction
            of his value without becoming small and weak on that account: those
            richest in health who are equal to most misfortunes and therefore
            not so afraid of misfortunes--human beings who are sure of their
            power and represent the attained strength of humanity with conscious
            pride.

          <p class="bg-grey">
            My friends, it was hard for us when we were young: we suffered youth
            itself like a serious sickness. That is due to the time into into
            which we have been thrown--a time of extensive inner decay and
            disintegration, a time that with all its weaknesses, and even with
            its best strength, opposes the spirit of youth. Disintegration
            characterizes this time, and thus uncertainty: nothing stands firmly
            on its feet or on a hard faith in itself; one lives for tomorrow, as
            the day after tomorrow is dubious. Everything on our way is slippery
            and dangerous, and the ice that still supports us has become thin:
            all of us feel the warm, uncanny breath of of thawing wind, where we
            walk, soon no one will be able to walk.

            If this is not an age of decay and declining vitality, it is at
            least one of headlont and arbitrary
            <i>experimentation:</i>--and it is probable that a superbundance of
            bungled experiments should create an overall impression as of
            decay--and perhaps even decay itself.

            An able craftsman of a scholar cuts a fine figure when he takes
            pride in his art and looks on life content and satisfied. But
            nothing looks more wretched than when a shoemaker or schoolmaster
            gives us to understand with a suffering mien that he was really born
            for something better. There us nothing better than what is good--and

            Today, in our time when the state has an absurdly fat stomach, there
            are in all fields and departments, in addition to the real workers,
            also "representatives"; e.g., besides the scholars also scribblers,
            besides the suffering classes also garrulous, boastful
            ne'er-do-wells who "represent" this suffering, not to speak of the
            professional politicians who are well off while "representing"
            distress with powerfull lungs before parliment. Our modern life os
            extremely expensive owing to the large numbers of intermediaries; in
            an ancient city, on the other hand, and, echoing that, also in many
            cities in Spain and Italy, one appeared oneself and would have given
            a hoot to such modern representatives and intermediaries--or a kick!

            To generalize: feelings about values are always behind the times;

            of a crusial and most essential growth, of the transition to the new
            conditions of existence, that the most extreme form of pessimism,
            genuine nihilism, would come into the world,

            <i>The inversion of the order of rank.</i> The pious counterfeiters,
            the priests, among us become chandalas, quacks, counterfeiters, and
            wizards; we consider them corrupters of the will, great slanderers
            of life on which they wish to revenge themselves, rebels among the
            underprivileged. We have turned the caste of servants, the Sudras,
            into middle class, our "Volk"["people"], those who make political
            decisions.

            Socialism--as the logical conclusion of the <i>tyranny</i>of the
            least and the dumbest, i.e., those who are superficial, envious, and
            three-quarters actors--is indeed entailed by "modern ideas" and
            their latent anachism; but in the tepid air of democratic well-being
            the capacity to reach conclusions, or to finish, weakens. One
            follows--but one no longer sees what follows. Therefore socialism is
            on the whole a hopeless and sour affair; and nothing opffers a more
            amusing spectacle than the contrast between the poisonous abd
            desperate faces cut by today's socialists--and to what wretched and
            pinched feelings their style bears witness!--and the harmless lambs'
            happiness of their hopes and desiderata. Nevertheless, in many
            places in Europe they may yet bring off occasional coups and
            attacks: there will be deep "rumblings" in the stomach of the next
            century, and the Paris commune, which has its apologists and
            advocates in Germany, too, was perhaps no more than a minor
            idigestion compared to what is coming. But there will always be too
            many who have possessions for socialism to signify more than an
            attack of sickness--and those who have possessions are of one mind
            on one article of faith: "one must want to have more than one has in
            order to <i>become</i>more". For this is the doctrine preached by
            life itself to all that has life: the morality of development. To
            have and to want to have more-- <i>growth</i>,in one word--that is
            life its self. In the doctrine of socialism there is hidden, rather
            badly, a "will to negate life"; the human beings of races that think
            up sucha a doctrine must be bungled. Indeed, I should wish that a
            few great experiments might prove that in a socialist society life
            negates itself, cuts off its own roots. The earth is large enough
            and man still sufficiently unexhausted; hence such a practical
            instruction and <i>demonstratio ad absurdum</i> would not strike me
            as undesirable even if it were gained and paid for with tremendous
            expenditure of human lives. In any case, even as a restless mole
            under the soil of a society that wollows in stupidity, socialism
            will be able to be something useful and theraputic: it delays "peace
            on earth" and the total mollificatin of the democratic herd animal;
            it forces the Europeans to retain spirit, of clarity, sobriety, and
            coldness of the spirit--it protects Europe for the time being from
            the <i>marasmus femoninus</i>that threatens it.
